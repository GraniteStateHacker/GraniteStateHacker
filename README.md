Hi, I’m Jim Wilcox, software architect with Insight Solutions.  

I'm also Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies since 2019.

- 👀 I’m interested in all things software development, but especially in the Microsoft tools space.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the things (never stop!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help people, especially community outreach.
- 📫 How to reach me?  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimwilcox2/)

- 🤓 One of the fun things I keep here on GitHub is my book, [Faith Hacker](https://faithhackerbook.com), and its website.  I wrote the manuscript using Visual Studio Code and Markdown Monster in markdown.
